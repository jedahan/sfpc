### Notes
Like energy, complexity cannot be created or destroyed.  It can only be deferred.

### Homework - write a puzzle
  - write some code that gives some output, then give the output to someone who will try to figure out how it was made.
  - convey some idea, explain it to yourself, deliver it to someone else.
    - sin, cos, using scaling multipliers and offsets, converting ranges to percent to use as a scaling factor
